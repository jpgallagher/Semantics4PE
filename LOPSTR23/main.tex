\section{Introduction}

The goal of this work is to transform big-step operational semantics to small-step operational semantics.
This has previously been studied \cite{Vesely-Fisher,Hulzing,Ambal}, as has the related problem of deriving abstract
machines from big-step semantics \cite{Ager}. The main novelty is the method, which we consider to be more
direct and more easily verifiable than previous approaches.  We formulate the transformation as the specialisation of a
linearising interpreter for big-step semantic rules.  Once a suitable interpreter has been written, in which the general
definition of a ``small step" has been encoded, the transformation
consists of partially evaluating it with respect to given big-step semantics.  The specialised interpreter contains the 
small-step transition rules, 
with minor syntactic modification. We describe experiments using an off-the shelf partial evaluator 
for logic programs \cite{Logen}.

In Section \ref{background} we review the notions of big-step and small-step operational semantics, and
the essential concepts behind program transformation using interpreter specialisation, with focus on interpreters for
Horn clause programs.

\section{Background}

\subsection{Operational Semantics}
The operational semantics of a program is usually defined in one of two styles, 
which are called \emph{natural semantics} and \emph{structural operational semantics}~\cite{NielsonN1992}.
Natural semantics (NS) was explicitly proposed by Kahn in the 
1980s \cite{Kahn87}; the name indicates an analogy with natural deduction. 
Structural operational semantics (SOS) was formulated by Plotkin \cite{Plotkin1981,Plotkin04a}, 
who later wrote an account of the origins of SOS \cite{Plotkin04}.  The motivation of SOS was to define
``machine-like" execution of programs, but in a syntax-directed style, omitting all unnecessary details of
the machine.  Both styles have their advantages, which we do not discuss in detail here.

The nicknames \emph{big-step} and \emph{small-step} for NS and SOS respectively have been used
since at least the early 1990s, and we use them in the rest of the paper, since they neatly
express the difference between NS and SOS.  Both approaches define the behaviour of a program
as runs in a transition system, whose configurations are of the form $\langle s, \sigma\rangle$ where $s$ is a
syntactic expression (such as a statement) and $\sigma$ is a program state; sometimes $s$ is omitted when it is empty
or a halt statement.  

In big-step semantics, transitions are of the form $\langle s, \sigma\rangle \Rightarrow \sigma'$, 
which means that $s$ is completely executed in state $\sigma$, terminating in final state $\sigma'$.
The name \emph{big-step} semantics arises since the transition for a statement goes from the initial to the final state.  
%
By contrast, in small-step semantics, a transition has the form $\langle s, \sigma\rangle \rightarrow \langle s',\sigma'\rangle$, 
which defines a single step
that moves from $s$ in state $\sigma$ to the \emph{next} statement $s'$ and next state $\sigma'$. We may also have a transition
$\langle s, \sigma\rangle \rightarrow \sigma'$ for the case that $s$ terminates in one step.
A computation or run is defined as a 
chain of small steps.  Note that we use $\Rightarrow$ and $\rightarrow$ for big and small-step transitions respectively.

\subsection{Interpreter specialisation}

The idea of specialising a program with respect to partial input,  known as program specialisation, partial evaluation or mixed computation, 
originated in the 1960s \cite{Lombardi,Ershov}.  In 1971, Futamura discussed the specialisation of interpreters, and its connection to compilers and compiler 
generators \cite{Futamura71}.  In particular, the specialisation of a program interpreter with respect to an object program,  but with unknown
program state (known as the first Futamura projection) is analogous to compilation of the object 
program into the language in which the interpreter is written.  
When the interpreter is written in the same language as that of the object program,
the result of specialisation may be viewed as a source transformation of the object program 
(whereas it is in fact a transformation of the interpreter). 
The transformation can be regarded as the imposition of (possibly non-standard) semantics encoded in the
interpreter onto the object program. 
This idea was exploited to transform programs, \cite{Gallagher,Turchin,Glueck,Jones,Giacobazzi}, and can result in deep changes in program structure, 
possibly yielding superlinear speedups, in contrast to partial evaluation itself, which gives only linear speedups and does not fundamentally alter program
structure.  Furthermore, it has been shown that some established program transformations such as deforestation
can be realised as interpreter specialisation \cite{Glueck}.  A transformation technique for logic programs with a similar 
aim, \emph{compiling control} \cite{BruynoogheDeS},
has also been shown to be realisable as interpreter specialisation \cite{Nys}.

The idea of transformation by interpreter specialisation is thus well known, yet its potential has not been fully realised, probably due to the 
fact that effective specialisation of complex interpreters is beyond the power of general purpose program specialisers and needs 
further research \cite{GallagherGlueck}.

\subsection{Horn clause representation of semantics and interpreters}

Both big-step and small-step transitions have the form of rules with premisses and conclusion, typically written in the following form.
\[
\dfrac{\mathit{premisses}} 
{\mathit{conclusion}} 
~~~~\mathrm{if }~ \mathit{condition}
\]
With a suitable encoding of syntactic objects and program states as first-order terms, this is a first-order logic implication
$\mathit{premisses} \wedge \mathit{condition} \rightarrow \mathit{conclusion}$ 
(here $\rightarrow$ stands for logical implication).
The conclusion is an atomic formula
$\langle s, \sigma\rangle \Rightarrow \sigma'$ (big-step) or $\langle s, \sigma\rangle \rightarrow \langle s',\sigma'\rangle$ (small-step),
where $\Rightarrow$ and $\rightarrow$ are first order predicates, so assuming that the premisses and conditions are conjunctions,
the transition rules are Horn clauses.

The close connection between transition rules and Horn clauses, and hence to the logic programming language Prolog, 
was noticed by Kahn and his co-workers in their work on big-step semantics.
A set of big-step transition rules written as Horn clauses can be executed as a logic program. This was exploited in
the Typol tool \cite{Typol}. Similarly, small step transition rules, together with a rule specifying a run of
small-step transitions, can also be regarded as a logic program.

Interpreters for logic programs can themselves be written as logic programs, where the program being interpreted 
is represented in some suitable way as a data structure in the interpreter.  

We summarise our approach as follows.  Let $I(x,y)$ be a logic program implementing an interpreter for a set of
big-step semantics rules $x$ and an object program $y$. $I$ is written in a small-step style (see next section).  Let logic program $B$ be the big-step semantics
for some programming language, and let $\lceil B \rceil$ be the representation of $B$ in the interpreter.  Then we specialise 
$I(\lceil B \rceil,y)$.  The resulting specialised interpreter $I_B(y)$ is a logic program containing (after some minor syntactic modification) 
the small-step semantic rules
corresponding to $B$.

\section{A small-step interpreter for big-step semantics}

\paragraph{Linear interpretation.}  Figure \ref{fig:linear-interp} shows the main clauses of a linear interpreter for any Horn clause program $P$.  
The predicate \texttt{clause(Head,Body)} is used to access the clauses of $P$.  The predicate \texttt{solve(As)} has as argument a stack of atoms, and
at each step the atom at the top of the stack \texttt{A}, is replaced by the (instance of the) body of a clause whose head unifies with \texttt{A}.
We ignore for now the treatment of builtin predicates such as arithmetic.
To run a goal \texttt{A} in $P$ we run \texttt{run([A])} in the interpreter.  
Correctness of the interpreter follows from the soundness and completeness of linear resolution.
\begin{figure}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\begin{lstlisting}
solve([A|As]) :- 
	clause(A,B),
	solveConstraints(B,B1),
	append(B1,As,As1),
	solve(As1).
solve([]).
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tabular}
\caption{Clauses from a linear interpreter.}\label{fig:linear-interp}
\end{figure}

This interpreter could be specialised with respect to a given $P$.  This corresponds roughly to transforming $P$ to continuation-passing
style, also known as binary logic programs \cite{Demoen}.

\paragraph{Linear interpreter for big-step semantics.} 
Our interpreter for big-step semantics follows a similar pattern; however, big-step semantics clauses have certain
properties to be discussed in detail shortly, which we can exploit.  Secondly, instead of performing one resolution step on each cycle of the interpreter,
as in Figure \ref{fig:linear-interp}, we wish to execute a number of resolution steps corresponding to whatever we define to be a ``small step" in the 
program execution.  Writing this part of the interpreter is the crucial part of the whole method.

\begin{figure}
\begin{tabular}{l}
\begin{lstlisting}
solve([A|As]) :- 
	smallStep(A,As,As1),
	solve(As1).
solve([]).
\end{lstlisting}
\end{tabular}
